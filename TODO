[ ] Test: set L0 status as kPersist when memtable gets full.
[ ] Multi-threaded recovery
[v] Write log with l0_id
[ ] Read l0_id on recovery
  - kFull
  - memtable->next is set?
[v] Set L0 status as full when its memtable got full
    - Write pmem_l0_info
      - Level0Status::kFull
      - MemTableList::NewMutable()
[v] Persist p value (pmem_log_block)

pmem_log_block
  - set block id

pmem_log
  - count up block_cnt
  - decide how to define a head node
    - affects iterator in recovery
    - affects PmemLog construction

WAL mode
  - recovery
    - read log record
